This file records my progress in tag sorting program and problems I have encountered.

10/15/19
Problem 1:
The leading 0s cannot be held when converting the string to int using substr() function.

Problem 2:
Not sure if the transfer from strings like "#12345678" to int is correct

Problem 3:
Not sure about the "Modified" or "YES" codes in the sample file, temporarily set their value to 4. Also failed to spot any
"delete" code in the sample file provided.

To be implemented:
1. File reading and processing function
2. Incorporate with the sorting.cpp


10/16/19
1. Implemented tag() class with info_output method.
2. Variables in tag() class are set private from now on.
3. Added overloaded operators for comparisons between keywords in tag() class.
4. SetAll() function to do two things in one call.
5. New test for overloaded operators.

TODO: 
1. File reading
2. Dynamic tag[] array that stores every line.
3. Sorting function.

10/17/19
1. Added readfile() function to the sorting program.
2. Dynamic Array class of tag() class.

Problem 4: failed tag[] array test.

10/18/19
1. Fully functioning tag[] array.
Problem#4 fixed

11/13/19
1.Added tag_compare() function based on groups(first) and elements(second).
